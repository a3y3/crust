Good checkpoint writeup and presentation.

Looks to be solid progress.  Seems that you did some good investigatio of the
ecosystem and found some good external crates to build upon.  Happy to see that
using a simple HTTP server for the communication is working out and that you
discovered some pros and cons for different web frameworks.  Also, nice to use
docker to simulate a number of different nodes, and dockertest seems to be a
nice way of integrating it with Rust.

Do be sure that you are putting sufficient time and effort into understanding
Chord and implementing the actual protocol.  As mentioned, there will probably
need to be some mechanism for nodes to join the DHT and for the DHT to recognize
that nodes have left.


Score: 10/10
