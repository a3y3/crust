Looks to be a nice robust project for a team of 2.

Good progression from core deliverable to strech goals, but would really be nice
to get the full Chord protocol running with O(log n).

Will want to think about the right types/traits for keys and values.  Both may
need to be serialized in order to distribute them.

Also, would need to have a protocol for joining the DHT, for distributing
key-value pairs and lists of nodes, and for recognizing and reconfiguring after
node failures.


Score: 10/10
